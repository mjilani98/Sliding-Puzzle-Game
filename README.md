Overview
  This is a 3×3 sliding puzzle app developed in Java and XML using Android Studio.
  The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and dynamically creates the layout.
  The objective is to rearrange the numbers on the initial board by swapping them with the blank slot to match the goal board.

Features

  Two 3×3 boards: one initial board with a shuffled arrangement and one goal board with a sorted arrangement.
  
  Four directional buttons (Up, Down, Left, Right) to swap the blank slot with its adjacent numbers.
  
  Dynamically created user interface with an emphasis on aesthetics (colors, fonts, spacing).
  
  The initial board updates after every move while the goal board remains unchanged.
  
  A dialog box is displayed upon successful completion.
